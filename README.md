# Creating Comics with LLMs
   By Ruhao Yang, Ben Mc Dowell and Zeina Khattab. 
   
The goal of the project is be able to automatically generate comic strips with minimal human input. The only user input should be prompting for a topic. After that the story, characters and visuals will all be generated by calls to the OpenAI api. 


Sprint 1

The Comix-with-LLM is a Java application that provides an interface to interact with the OpenAI API.
This application supports 2 functionalities: Chat Completion and Text Embedding Retrieval.
It allows users to specify their API credentials and input data for performing these tasks.

This consists of : API.java which contains methods for interacting with OpenAI API.
                   Main.java which has the main method to execute the application, asking user for input and invoking API methods.
                   pom.xml which is the Maven configuration file that specifies dependencies and build settings.

To run the application, compile the project using Maven (mvn package).
After that, go to the target directory and execute the JAR file using the following command:
java -jar Comix-with-LLM-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY    (Replace YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY with the actual API key)
Follow the prompts and input the correct information and the application will perform the tasks.
